# Jollof 

This is a very lighweight PHP framework built to cater to very busy backend-developers who have very little time to deliver on the job. It is also very configurable as most of the boilerplate code you need to get up and running on a serious project has already been baked in. Web development has never been this easy!

The aim of the framewrok is to make it very easy to develop applications with little or no friction as regards the ever changing landscape of web development.

## Setting Up

The philosophy of **Jollof** is very simple. _Routes_ are very tightly knitted to the _Controllers_ that service them. For every route, the first part of the URI and/or path is the Controller class name and the second part of the URI and/or path is the Controller class method.

It's a new way of thinking about the way applications should be crafted!

All you need to setup can be found in the **documentation** folder(s) of the project starter folder.
